# CreditCardDataAnalysis

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 (about 0.17%) are fraudulent, resulting in a highly imbalanced class distribution. Each transaction is represented by 30 features: 28 of these are anonymized numerical features (V1 through V28), derived from a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation to protect sensitive information, while the remaining two features are Time and Amount. The Time variable represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, while Amount indicates the transaction amount. The target variable, Class, is a binary label where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction. Due to the class imbalance, specialized techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are necessary to improve the model’s ability to detect fraud accurately. This dataset is commonly used to develop and evaluate models for fraud detection in credit card transactions.

In this project, I built a credit card fraud detection model using Python, focusing on addressing the challenges of class imbalance, which is a common issue in fraud detection. Fraud detection in financial transactions is essential in the real world to protect consumers and businesses from financial losses and to maintain trust in digital payment systems. With the rise in online financial activities, identifying fraudulent transactions among a large number of legitimate ones is increasingly important.

I started by loading and inspecting a dataset of credit card transactions to understand its structure and check for any missing values. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced—meaning there are far fewer fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones—I used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic examples of fraudulent transactions. This balanced the dataset, making it easier for my machine learning model to learn patterns for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
