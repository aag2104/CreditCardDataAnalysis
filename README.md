# CreditCardDataAnalysis

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 (about 0.17%) are fraudulent, resulting in a highly imbalanced class distribution. Each transaction is represented by 30 features: 28 of these are anonymized numerical features (V1 through V28), derived from a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation to protect sensitive information, while the remaining two features are Time and Amount. The Time variable represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, while Amount indicates the transaction amount. The target variable, Class, is a binary label where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction. Due to the class imbalance, specialized techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are necessary to improve the modelâ€™s ability to detect fraud accurately. This dataset is commonly used to develop and evaluate models for fraud detection in credit card transactions.
